# Mario Kart 8 Deluxe Random Build Generator

This discord bot creates you a random build containing a set of 1 character, 1 body, 1 tire and 1 glider and also displays the stats of this build.  
It's also possible to create multiple builds at the same time up to 12. 
> Please keep in mind that statistics only get rendered for 1 build and **not** for multiple
